------------------

Welcome! In this proof-of-concept we'll be looking at the new Multi-Site DCI functionality introduced in Dell Enterprise SONiC 4.0. This allows users to more efficiently set up L2-adjacent connectivity between datacenters that are running VXLAN/BGP/EVPN. For accomplishing this, we utilize border gateways (BGW).
