------------------

Welcome! In this proof-of-concept we'll be looking at the new Multi-Site DCI functionality introduced in Dell Enterprise SONiC 4.0. This allows users to more efficiently set up L2-adjacent connectivity between datacenters that are running VXLAN/BGP/EVPN. For accomplishing this, we utilize border gateways (BGW).

## üöÄ Description and Objective

Walking through this example of how to leverage the new Multi-Site DCI functionality present in Dell Enterprise SONiC 4.0+ should get you familiar with building out L2 extension connectivity between datacenters enabling you to adopt these concepts into your production builds.


## üìã Requirements

  * GNS3 / EVE-NG virtual environment or physical hardware
  * Dell Enterprise SONiC 4.0 or newer (virtual image for virtual environment or Enterprise-licensed version for hardware)
  * Ansible Core 2.12.10 or later.
  * The latest version of the SONiC collection from Ansible Galaxy:
		  - $ ansible-galaxy collection install dellemc.enterprise_sonic

## üîç Verification Commands
   * show vxlan tunnel - On the Border Leafs, verify the 'Internal' and 'External' tunnels are up between VTEPs.
   * show vxlan vlanvnimap - Output shows the VLAN to VNI mapping in the data center. This mapping is defined with 
     different VNI values for the same VLANs in data center1 and 2. Check this show command on the Border Leafs
   * show evpn rmac vni all - Output shows the remote MAC address reachable from Border Leafs. The values indicate remote mac 
     addresses of remote BLs' router MACs. Check out how it is in all border routers.
   * show ip route vrf Vrf1 - Verify routes learned in Vrfs.
   * show bgp l2vpn evpn route type macip - Display Type 2 routes learned.
   * show bgp l2vpn evpn route type prefix - Dis[play Type 5 routes.
